The US has unveiled the world's most powerful supercomputer called 'Summit', beating the previous record-holder China's Sunway TaihuLight. With a peak performance of 200,000 trillion calculations per second, it is over twice as fast as Sunway TaihuLight, which is capable of 93,000 trillion calculations per second.
